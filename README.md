# PESU PDF Helper

An all-in-one browser extension designed to supercharge the learning experience on the PESU Academy website. This tool transforms from a simple PDF utility into a comprehensive personal study dashboard.

It addresses common workflow frustrations by providing integrated PDF controls, automatic organization, and insightful study habit tracking.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Integrated PDF Controls:** "Open in New Tab" and "Download" buttons appear directly on the webpage next to the PDF you're viewing, providing instant access without leaving the page.
- **Smart Popup Menu:** The extension icon is context-aware.
  - **On a PESU Academy page**, it provides a one-click link to your personal study dashboard.
  - **On any other website**, it becomes a quick-launch button to open the PESU Academy website.
- **Personal Study Dashboard:** A central hub to visualize and manage your study habits.
  - **Live Time Tracking:** See a live-updating timer of the total time you've spent on the PESU website _today_.
  - **Daily Reset & History:** The timer automatically resets each day, and your previous days' totals are logged in a "Daily History" list.
  - **Recent Topics:** Automatically saves a direct link to the PDF of the last topic you visited for each subject, making it easy to jump back in.
- **Seamless Topic Saving:** When you visit a page with a PDF, the topic is automatically saved to your dashboard, and a sleek, non-intrusive notification appears to confirm it.
- **Intelligent File Naming:** When downloading, PDFs are automatically named after the specific **topic** (e.g., `Basic concepts of ecosystem.pdf`), not the generic subject, keeping your notes perfectly organized.
