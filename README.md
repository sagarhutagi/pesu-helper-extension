# PESU PDF Helper

An all-in-one browser extension designed to supercharge the learning experience on the PESU Academy website. This tool transforms from a simple PDF utility into a comprehensive personal study dashboard.

It addresses common workflow frustrations by providing integrated PDF controls, automatic organization, and insightful study habit tracking with a clean, modern interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Integrated PDF Controls:** Icon-only "Open in New Tab" and "Download" buttons appear directly in the top-right corner of the PDF frame when you click to view a topic, providing instant access without leaving the page.
- **Smart Popup Menu (Dark Theme):** The extension's icon is context-aware.
  - **On a PESU Academy page**, it provides a one-click link to your personal study dashboard.
  - **On any other website**, it becomes a quick-launch button to open the PESU Academy website (which will redirect to login if needed).
- **Personal Study Dashboard:** A central hub to visualize and manage your study habits, featuring a modern dark theme and an optimized layout.
  - **Live Time Tracking:** See a live-updating timer showing the total time spent actively viewing course topics or PDFs _today_.
  - **Daily Reset & History:** The timer resets daily, and previous days' totals are logged in a compact "Daily History" list.
  - **Subject Progress Tracker:** Automatically syncs your enrolled subjects from the "My Courses" page. Track your progress across 4 units per subject (Theory, Numericals, Revision 1, Revision 2) using an interactive accordion view.
  - **Exam Filter:** Filter the progress tracker to show only relevant units for ISA 1, ISA 2, or ESA.
  - **Recent Topics:** Automatically saves a direct link to the **PDF** of the last topic you visited for each subject, making it easy to jump back into your study materials.
  - **About Section:** Includes developer info and details about the extension.
- **Seamless Topic Saving:** When you visit a page with a PDF, the topic is automatically saved to your dashboard, and a sleek, non-intrusive notification ("‚úÖ Topic Saved") appears on the page.
